Quite often we see csv either with comma or pipe seperated in real time scenario.
But there are cases where certain source systems can send fixed width flat files.
How to handle such files in IDMC CDI and load it to a table in relational database ?

First: We need to create the template of fixed width file format.
--> Click on new --> Components --> Fixed width file format --> create
--> Fill in the necessary details like name, location to save ( default ) , description if any
--> connection details --> connect to the location where sample file is stored --> sample file
---> Manually select the length for each column --> Click on edit columns and give names for each column header.
With this our template is ready

While configuring the source in the mapping --> go to formatting options --> select flat file type as fixed width and give the template which we created as reference.

By this steps we can process the fixed width flat files into rdbms or any other target systems by using IDMC CDI.
